There are various competing rumors of his origin tossed about on the street, the most common of which is that he was abandoned on the town outskirts at a young age. We would ask him where his parents are but he can barely seem to remember anything from more than a few days ago.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/halomademeapc/characters/28469919">Character Sheet</a></p><h2>Pigeon Contempt</h2><p>Magobak has a burning hatred for pigeons and all fowl-kind (or anything that someone can convince him is a pigeon). &nbsp;This began in the quest <a href="/journals/2020-05-11">Cultists in the Sacred Grove</a> when a pigeon emitted droppings on him in the morning. &nbsp;Since that point, his attentions have been solely dedicated to the unanimous destruction of the pigeon species, though he might get distracted and forget this goal entirely if he sees something shiny. &nbsp;</p><h2>Quest History</h2><ul><li><a href="/journals/2020-05-11">Cultists in the Sacred Grove</a></li></ul>
