Her skin is a dark shade of red and her eyes a bright gold, as if she was born from the fires of hell. Being a tiefling, people don't trust her and she doesn't trust them. So, Naza doesn't talk much to others and will respond shortly rather then having long conversatiosn. Unless you start talking about battle, suddenly she's more chatty. She is a protector, so if you earn her trust or respect she will die before allowing you to.</p><p>Naza comes from the Bloodline of Zariel, an archdevil of the Nine Hells and ruler of Avernus. Zariel and her bloodline live to fight and judge others on their combat skills and williness to use those skills. Naza is one of the trusted soldiers Zariel has sent out to seek soldiers who would be willing to make a bargains to hone their combat skills...so long as they are loyal servants to Zariel. This is what has brought Naza to these lands: search for soldiers.</p><p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1deZ2shtU7xWO8SmZn4-VQMnPzDkmgnnL/view?usp=sharing">Character Sheet</a></p><h2>Quest History</h2><ul><li><a href="/journals/2020-05-15">A Statuesque Mystery Beyond the Woods</a></li></ul>
