She wanted to join in his place, but he realized her intentions and prevented her. (What kind of father would he be if he let his daughter die for him?) She was determined to look after him, though, and so she became a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camp_follower">camp follower</a> traveling with the Vandemar military, looking after not only her father but others as she got to know them. It was during this time that she started to learn field medicine. &nbsp;She didn't receive much notice for her efforts until one day, during a critical battle, things went horribly awry. &nbsp;With so many wounded and dying around her, Mulan suddenly seemed to come into her own. &nbsp;She was hailed as a savior, and the battle was eventually won. &nbsp;However, she does not talk much about that day herself and will only give simple platitudes when asked about it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Quest History</h2><ul><li><a href="/journals/2020-05-15">A Statuesque Mystery Beyond the Woods</a></li></ul>
