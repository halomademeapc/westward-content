<p>Position: On Town Council, as the Guard Captain at Last Resort&nbsp;</p><p>Description: A tall, older wood elf who take crap from no one. He is always carrying around his twin sabers, even in town council meetings. His gaze will set even an orc to trembling. While he isn't one for making speeches, or even saying 2 sentences at the same time, he is often seen helping the elderly with chores, listening to a poor woman crying over a rejected love, or even playing tag with some local hoodlums.&nbsp;</p><figure class="image"><img src="https://i.pinimg.com/originals/69/bb/3b/69bb3ba35ca59b732f8bbca0cd10103d.jpg" alt="Elves versus Dwarves - Oh the ClichÃ© | Elf warrior, Elf ranger ..."></figure>
