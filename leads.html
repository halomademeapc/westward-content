Of course, the guard don't seem too concerned, but someone should really check that out</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Some of my boys were out exploring to the west, and seem to have discovered some lost ruins of some sort to the West. I wonder what type of buried treasure there might be hidden away?</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Do you remember that fishing village people started a few months ago? Whatever happened to them? I haven't heard of them for several weeks now.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I heard that some idiot stumbled into a sacred grove up north! He's just lucky he made it out alive. I heard that cult stuff is likely to make sacrifices on any interloper they find.</p></blockquote>
