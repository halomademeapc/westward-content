They are basically unreadable without an expert to translate them.</p><p>The group then entered the city ruins, where they found a small pack of kobolds with mining equipment entering a building. Mulan's familiar, Tinkerbell, went off to investigate; when she checked on Tink she found that the sprite had been knocked unconscious and was untrackable. Mulan began to follow the kobolds, and the party came along. At a major square of the town they found a young black dragon atop a tower, who spotted them and proceeded to attack the group.</p><p>Dragon's name is Krog. KROG HAS NO CHILL. ACID EVERYWHERE. MUCH FIGHTING. ALL BUT MAGOBAK FALL TO THE DRAGON. Magobak hefted his mighty Trident of Pigeon Slaying, pinned the dragon's tail to the pavement, then tore the dragon's wings off and stabbed them through its eyes.</p><p>[Achievement Unlocked: Not Quite Dragonmeat]</p><p>A group of ten kobolds jump out from behind a wall and run like hell from the dragonslayer(s).</p><p>Everyone managed to succeed their death saves, and Mulan managed to identify Tink, who had earned a scolding for being so careless.</p><p><a href="https://westward-wiki.halomademeapc.com/characters/npc/Jolel">Jolel the archeologist </a>flew in on a hippogriff and thanked the group for dealing with that troublesome dragon. Jolel claimed eminent domain on the loot at the top of the tower, citing a claim from the Wizard's Guild. After an argument, Jolel stormed off, then flew his Hippogriff to the top of the tower.</p><p>The party (minus Magobak, who stayed behind to carve up the dragon) ran up the tower. They found Jolel stuffing some items into a bag and running back to his hippogriff. The party injured and knocked out the hippogriff, which caused Jolel to stop, hurl the bag over the edge of the tower, and tend to his companion. The party turned their attention to the loot. Jolel performed some quick healing/surgery on his hippogriff, then proclaimed that the Adventurer's guild would pay for what happened here before flying off.</p><p>Meanwhile Magobak recovered the bag that Jolel dropped, which contained a number of books and scrolls written in Olde Elvish.</p></blockquote><p>- <a href="https://westward-wiki.halomademeapc.com/characters/player/delacroix">Delacroix</a></p>
