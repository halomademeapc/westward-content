> Morv(Spelling?), Drum Style, and William met at the guild hall of Last Hope early on June 1st to prepare to investigate rumors of cultist activity nearby. While waiting to depart Morv was viciously pooped on by a pigeon and was unable to get revenge, starting a blood war. The party was unable to find their fourth member, Mairon, and decided to leave without him. After encountering and easily destroying a group of giant wolf spiders in the woods Mairon was finally able to catch up to the rest of the party. Newly reinforced, the party ambushed and killed some cult members and "persuaded" the survivors to spill the secrets of their demonic cult. After telling us what they knew they suddenly and mysteriously died without warning. Once inside the hideout we found a little girl sealed by magic runes that Mairon revealed to be a demon. It left a magic battle axe on the gound but we were not foolish enough to break it's seal. A magician may be able to obtain the axe without crossing the line of runes. We found a statue with blood and treasure in it but it turned into a demon and attacked us. After a glorious battle the monster was vanquished and the heroes returned to town without delving into the depth of the lair, thinking it better to live and come back another day.
