I took some time to research what passes as nobility out here on the border, and by far the biggest target is named Andross Guile. He is a noble who went far out of his way to come to the frontier and become a key benefactor of the Adventurer’s Guild. Clearly he has put a lot of stake in becoming even wealthier by taking a cut of our exploits. I look forward to working with him and seeing what sort of riches we can relieve him of. I went to his estate with under the pretense of wanting to better know our benefactor, and to ask how we may serve him. I was accompanied with Mulan and Torgar, two other adventurers with whom I have fought beside—they remain unaware of our larger plans, though I will test if their goals align with ours in due time.&nbsp;</p><p>Guile’s estate lies a short way out of the city, though the road is better paved and cobbled than Last Haven’s main square. Very large building, complete with walls around the grounds. It seems he has moved a piece of his former station along with him; this is not a man who does things halfway. We first met his son, Kyle, a typical rich boy born into privilege. Complete brat, but utterly loyal to his father. He does not seem enthusiastic about being out here on the frontier and likely longs to be back in the city socializing with the nobility. This should give me a way into the inner circle: I played the part of a person more accustomed to higher society and the man practically asked me out on a date!</p><p>I am getting ahead of myself. The lord himself is clearly a secretive man, but he granted us an audience. He is, after all, quite invested in the adventurer’s guild. He wants us to cooperate with the Wizard’s guild (whoops!) but he still wants us to report any findings of our findings regarding the Ruined City to him first. He also lent horses to the three of us for our journey back into said city, which made a six-hour march into a half-hour ride. For future journeys, he offered the use of his teleportation circle; though it will cost 200G worth of rubies to transport a whole party.</p><p>Once into the city proper, we found an old man being attacked by the statues—they freeze in the daylight, yes, but apparently they still move in the darkness of the buildings. Take out the thatch roof with a magic missile, however, and they once again freeze in the sunlight. The old man, Surdoe, was working with a blue-robed wizard named Fellen. Fellen is an expert in Olde Elvish who is studying the city… or he WAS, at least. We will get to that later. Fellen was with the Wizard’s guild and used a teleportation spell to help Surdoe back to the city. We teamed up with him for a time, and he showed us his current focus: a large building at the center of the city with some remarkable features. This building has an enormous gemstone set above one entrance: 50-feet wide, and completely seamless. The entrance itself was obstructed by a bluish barrier. To Fellen’s dismay, we threw caution to the wind and walked through the barrier. I do not expect you to believe what happened next, but here it is as I remember it:</p><p>Instantly, the city was ablaze all around us. Fighting in the streets. Soldiers charged out of the barracks within the building, though not at us. Their targets were a tiefling and three enormous rock golems, marching toward the center. Torgar’s soldiering instincts kicked in and he charged the tiefling summoner as well, and Mulan and I had to play support. Thankfully, after a few dangerous moments the city reverted to its present state: abandoned save for the moving-in-darkness statues, and much less on fire. The barrier behind us disappeared when we stepped through, though Fellen still shouted toward us as though it was still there—as, for him, it was! We reassured him that we made it through, and he crossed the threshold and disappeared. Shortly thereafter, he reappeared… or, more accurately, a statue of him reappeared, its face twisted in anguish and chest bearing a gaping hole. It seems he encountered the same scene that we did but did not fare so well alone in combat. Not wanting to leave evidence behind, I put the body/statue into my bag of holding, and we pressed on.&nbsp;</p><p>As we moved through the building, we had to pass through more of the blue barriers, and each one took us back in time to the siege of the city, following in the wake of the summoner and his golems. Each time we had to defend ourselves until the vision ended, and in one case a damaged rock golem remained in the present time. These rooms contained several interesting artifacts: a scrying pool, a collection of very old robes from high-ranking wizards, and some sort of magical apparatus that connected to various points in the city. We did not tamper these, as we could not interpret the writing on them.</p><p>After we entered the penultimate room, a red slaad approached us after the vision of the past ended. The slaad rebuked us for “meddling in one of the most important events in history” and warned us against going any further, lest we change the past. If he is to be believed, our glimpses of the past were not mere visions or recreations, but actual travel into the past. As for as for how or why the barriers were created, it did not say before walking around the corner and disappearing.</p><p>By this time, we were exhausted from combat and travel, and between the slaad’s warning and the threat of what sort of battle might lay beyond the final barrier, we decided it prudent to not press any further. Mulan, however, instructed her familiar to turn invisible and move through the barrier to observe.&nbsp;</p><p>The familiar was light on details, but it described an epic struggle between the summoner and its remaining golem, and whatever last line of defense the city had to offer within the final chamber. In present day, the rock golem remains dormant, with glowing glyphs all over its body, and some sort of magical rod of great power in a pool of water. This absolutely warrants further investigation, all in due time.</p><p>The trip back to Last Haven was uneventful. We reported our findings back to Andross Guile, and he offered to take the statue of Fellen and, ah, cover up our involvement in any events which may have led to his demise. The old man we saved from the living statues last saw him in our company, after all.</p><p>The sorcery still obeys me, though I can sometimes feel it aching to lash out as if it has a mind—and a temper—of its own. Each time I passed through one of the magical barriers I felt it surge and boil up just beneath my skin. I have not yet experienced anything like what happened six months ago, but I fear that as my limits increase… well, surely I will be able to work it out. As you have said, there is always a way to turn a liability into an advantage.</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p><p>- <a href="https://westward-wiki.halomademeapc.com/characters/player/delacroix">Delacroix</a></p></blockquote>
